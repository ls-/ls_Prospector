## Features
- Swaps leystone ore for felsate if a gem chip of selected colour drops;
- To avoid any felslate loss, the addon **WILL NOT** allow you to use its prospecting macro again until it decides which ore to use, and loot window is closed;
- Shows info on future gem colour and amount of ore in your bags.

## Usage
- Install it;
- Use **`/LSPROSPECT`** or **`/LSP`** command to open UI;
- Select gem colours you're interested in;
- Start clicking "Prospecting" button or click "[W]" button (it's above "Prospecting" button) to create and pick up a macro, place this macro on your action bar, start spamming it.

**Note #1:** Macro will work only if addon's UI is visible.</br>
**Note #2:** In general, you **DO NOT** need to click "Swap Ore" button, it's there for emergency cases. For instance, if you forgot to select needed gem colour, but then saw a chip of said colour drop, you'd need to select that gem colour, click "Swap Ore" button, and then continue spamming either "Prospecting" button or addon's macro.
